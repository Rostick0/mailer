  "faqListTitle": "Frequently asked questions (FAQ)",
  "faqListSubtitle": "Quick help for commonly asked questions",
  "faqListItemBigTitle1": "How does MEGA’s zero-knowledge encryption work?",
  "faqListItemContent11": "This article is meant for a general audience. Advanced users can read our Security Whitepaper for a more detailed explanation of our encryption and other security-related processes.",
  "faqListItemTitle12": "What does “zero-knowledge” mean?",
  "faqListItemContent12": "Under zero-knowledge encryption, the sender encrypts a message, file, or audio and video stream on their device, and the recipients decrypt it on theirs, with the encryption key known only to the endpoints. This means that any third-party, including MEGA, can’t access the content of the encrypted data.",
  "faqListItemContent13": "Zero-knowledge encryption ensures that all communication is private and secure, protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged. MEGA’s zero-knowledge encryption relies on your password to unlock all of your account’s encrypted data. Your account is therefore only as secure as the password that you pick—if it’s too short, guessable, or used anywhere else, you will be at risk. Since your password is effectively a cryptographic key, there is another risk—if you lose it, you will render your account undecryptable. We can’t reset it on your behalf. Please ensure that you keep a copy of your recovery key in a safe location to regain access to your account if you forgot your password.",
  "faqListItemTitle13": "What does “zero-knowledge” mean?",
  "faqListItemContent14": "Just like any other service provider offering user accounts that are protected by a password, we or anyone for that matter can theoretically try and guess your password. How hard it is to do so all depends on the strength of your password. This is why we strongly recommend these three tips",
  "faqListItemLi11": "Create strong and unique passwords.",
  "faqListItemLi12": "Use a password manager.",
  "faqListItemLi13": "Enable two-factor authentication.",
  "faqListItemTitle14": "How do you encrypt my files and chats?",
  "faqListItemContent15": "We’ve established that MEGA has zero knowledge of your password and recovery key. MEGA continues this chain of encrypted keys to ensure that only the person who enters the correct account password can view that account’s decrypted information.",
  "faqListItemContent16": "Your files and folders are encrypted on your device with unique and randomly generated keys before they are sent to our servers. These keys are encrypted with your recovery key.",
  "faqListItemContent17": "To protect and authenticate cryptographic keys exchanged between users, we use asymmetric cryptography. Put simply, each MEGA user has a public key and a private key. When you send data, MEGA sends your recipient’s public key to your device to encrypt the data that you will send to them. Your recipient’s device then uses their private key to decrypt the data when they receive it. Similarly, when you receive data, MEGA sends your public key to your contact’s device to encrypt the data that will be sent to you. Your device then uses your private key to decrypt the data when you receive it. Either way, your private key is never shared with anyone and remains encrypted on our servers.",
  "faqListItemTitle15": "Summary",
  "faqListItemContent18": "Our zero-knowledge approach adds multiple layers of privacy and security through encryption. We don’t know or store your password. You’re the only one who has that ultimate key. Even if someone were to force us, we wouldn’t be able to reveal your password or your recovery key.",
  "faqListItemContent19": "We have no idea what information you store or share because they’re encrypted on your device before they get to our servers. The decryption process will not start until and unless you enter the correct password when you log in. Only you can view your decrypted information while you’re logged in. Similarly, only your intended recipients have the means to decrypt the information you share with them.",
  "faqListItemContent110": "Once again, this article is a functional but highly simplified explanation of how we keep your information private and secure. We highly recommend that you read our Security Whitepaper if you’re interested in the more technical details of our technology. ",
  "faqListItemContent111": "We also hope that this helped you appreciate the importance of securing not just your MEGA account password, but your recovery key as well.",
  "faqListItemContent112": "Finally, we can’t stress enough that despite all these efforts on our end, remember that your account can still be compromised in a variety of ways. If you use the same password for multiple accounts, you’re vulnerable to credential stuffing. Your password can also be stolen through phishing and malware. Of course, allowing anyone to gain physical access to your devices also greatly compromises the security of your accounts.",
  "faqListItemContent113": "Create strong and unique passwords to best protect your privacy and security. Use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords for all your online accounts. Enable two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security to your account. Turn on the built-in encryption on your device as your first line of defence against physical access. If your password is easily guessed or is revealed, our zero-knowledge encryption won’t be able to stop other people from accessing your information.",
  "faqListItemBigTitle2": "How do I secure my devices?",
  "faqListItemContent21": "Picking an end-to-end encrypted storage or communications provider is an essential step towards securing your online life. However, it is not in itself sufficient.",
  "faqListItemContent22": "The fundamental security benefits of zero-knowledge encryption instantly fall apart if you use an insecure password and your account is compromised, or if any of the devices that you access MEGA from are compromised.",
  "faqListItemContent23": "Think of your security as a chain, consisting of MEGA, your password, and all of your devices. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link. MEGA is a very strong link.",
  "faqListItemContent24": "We would like to outline some of the risks that your devices face and give you some basic tips on how to minimise them.",
  "faqListItemTitle22": "Bugs",
  "faqListItemContent25": "Software is written by humans. Humans are fallible. As a result, software can come with bugs. Some of these bugs can compromise your security:",
  "faqListItemLi21": "When you visit a web page that exploits an issue in your browser, the attacker can install a backdoor on your computer or mobile device.",
  "faqListItemLi22": "Your email client could fall victim to a phishing email or one that contains a virus or malware.",
  "faqListItemLi23": "Mobile operating systems can have vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely, for example via a text message.",
  "faqListItemContent26": "There is a myriad of attack vectors, and new ones are discovered from time to time.",
  "faqListItemContent27": "The good news is that software vendors and the open-source community strive to react quickly to security holes that are discovered in their products. They then release updates that fix them. Not installing these updates is dangerous. The longer you wait, the more widely known security issues accumulate",
  "faqListItemContent28": "Our advice: Regularly update your operating system, web browser, email client, and anything else that you use to open data received from other people, e.g. your PDF reader, image viewer, video player, instant messenger, etc.",
  "faqListItemTitle23": "Malware",
  "faqListItemContent29": "Exploiting a security vulnerability is not the only way of planting a backdoor on the computer or mobile device of a victim. Tricking people into installing software that contains such a backdoor is popular among less sophisticated cybercriminals. It is very important that you exercise utmost caution before installing software from a non-mainstream source.",
  "faqListItemTitle24": "Consequences",
  "faqListItemContent210": "Once a remote access backdoor has been planted on one of your devices, the attacker has a vast array of options. They include, but are not limited to:",

  "faqListItemBigTitle3": "What is the MEGA Desktop App?",
  "faqListItemContent31": "The MEGA Desktop app keeps data on your computer in sync with your MEGA Cloud drive. Whenever you change synced data on your computer, it will make the same change to your cloud drive.",
  "faqListItemContent32": "Multiple computers can sync to the same cloud folder, which will cause changes on any of the computers to first be applied to the cloud drive and subsequently to all other computers – you no longer have to email files back and forth or walk across the building with a USB stick in hand.",
  "faqListItemContent33": "You can choose between synchronising your entire MEGA Cloud drive or configuring multiple individual selective syncs. You can also setup a one-way backup where your local files are backed up to the cloud.",
